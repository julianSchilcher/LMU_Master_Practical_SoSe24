1. Hyperparameter Optimization (Robin)
2. Pruning (Niklas)
3. Growing the tree / losses (Julian)


Ideas:
1. Scaling of Unimodal loss for higher split_nodes above leaf nodes (setting to 0, divide by level in tree (height), no scaling)
    1. How do we deal with a node, that has a leaf node on one side + a split node on the other side? (setting to zero)
2. Growing the tree
    1. What is the dip value threshold that indicates a unimodal distribution?
3. Scaling of autoencoder reconstruction loss
4. Adjusting the projection axis: learning rate (0, 1e-8 to 1e-4)

Hyperparameter Optimization: https://browse.arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05847v3
1. Use Bayes Optim -> AxSearch + RayTune
2. Use Nevergrad + Ray Tune 
    1. PCABO + TwoPointsDE + ScrHammerslySearch
        1. Chaining?
3. Use Resampling -> cross-validation (only for supervised models)
    1. Use training set to train + validate on test set (inner loop) + and test on combined train+test set
    -> We want to optimize the models capability to produce clean dendrograms given class labels

Seed = 128
n_epochs = 60
batch_size = 256

Metrics to track with tensorboard (Setup Tensorflow Board logging):
1. Dendrogram purity (optimize on)
2. Leaf purity
3. Number of nodes (per batch)
4. Total loss (per batch)
5. All sub losses (Unimodal + Multimodal + reconstruction) (per batch)
7. All Losses per epoch
6. Flat metrics (NMI, ARI, ACC)

Tree growth: Y splits per x epochs

Strategy:
1. First, get best base architecture (using base parameters for learning rates) - understanding tree construction, loss construction + loss scaling (only for dip losses)
    1. Pruning strategy: (string) Moving Average or Epoch Assessment
    2. Pruning Threshold: (float) (Moving Average: 0.1; Epoch Assessment: int(dataset_size*0.001))
    3. Pruning Factor: (float) (0.5 default; how fast the moving average decreases)
    4. Tree growth frequency: (float) (Per x epoch: 2.0 -> calculated on batch numbers if 0 -> grow each batch)
    5. Tree growth amount: (int) (Y splits: 1 default; e.g. 20 (grow the tree iteratively as much as possible up to 20 splits))
    6. Tree growth threshold type: (string) max leaf nodes or unimodality reached
    7. Tree growth threshold: (int) max leaf nodes (20 default); (float) unimodality reached -> unimodality threshold (0.95 default)
    8. Unimodal loss application: (string) Leafnodes, All nodes, None
    9. Unimodal loss scaling factor: (string) node height (tree depth), node splits, None
    10. Unimodal loss scaling direction (influences factor calculation): (string) ascending (tree depth -> the deeper, the higher the loss factor), descending ((tree depth -> the deeper, the lower the loss factor))
    11. Unimodal loss scaling function (scales factor): (string) linear, exponential, log
    12. Multimodal loss application: (string) All nodes, Leaf nodes, None
    13. Multimodal loss scaling factor: (string) node height (tree depth), node splits, None
    14. Multimodal loss scaling direction (influences factor calculation): (string) ascending (tree depth -> the deeper, the higher the loss factor), descending ((tree depth -> the deeper, the lower the loss factor))
    15. Multimodal loss scaling function (scales factor): (string) linear, exponential, log
    16. Axis Learning rate: (float) fast (1e-4), slow (1e-8), None (0.0)
    17. Axis Learning application: (string) Leaf nodes, All nodes

2. Optimize architecture for base parameters (batch size, learning rate, loss scaling)
    1. Using resampling here?
    2. Early stopping: (string) No or After Tree cannot grow anymore (unimodality reached)
    3. reconstruction loss scaling (float|None)
    4. reconstruction learning rate (float)
    5. batch size (int)
    6. n_epochs (int)
    7. All other parameters from above with narrower search space (decision after first run)
