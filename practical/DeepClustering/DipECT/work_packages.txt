1. Hyperparameter Optimization (Robin)
2. Pruning (Niklas)
3. Growing the tree / losses (Julian)


Ideas:
1. Scaling of Unimodal loss for higher split_nodes above leaf nodes (setting to 0, divide by level in tree (height), no scaling)
    1. How do we deal with a node, that has a leaf node on one side + a split node on the other side? (setting to zero)
2. Growing the tree
    1. What is the dip value threshold that indicates a unimodal distribution?
3. Scaling of autoencoder reconstruction loss
4. Adjusting the projection axis: learning rate (0, 1e-8 to 1e-4)
